        What do you think about the current condition of software development in bangladesh and how this differ from the other developed countries?Also put a comment how we can improve ourselves as a giant digital developed nation in this field?
    </h3>

    <p>
    Currently the condition of software development in bangladesh is very optimistic. As a developed country we are trying to enlagre our IT sector and got stable. Now a days Governmnet trying to degitalze the country this is a big way to developed this area. on the other hand there are many private companies here working on this software development sector taht crate huge oppertunity to do better in this area. We are trying to do more like the developed country but here is a big difference between deve countries & bangladesh is quality. We focus on quantity where the developed country focus first quality then quantity. we try to do much but not following the quality. Another defference is invenstment. we have lack of invenstment. For better work we need more invenstment.

    From my personal point of view, if we want to be giant digital developed nation we have to focus on our work skill & assure quantity work. besides we need Governmnet & private invenstment to grow & stable.
